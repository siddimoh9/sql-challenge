Assignment Overview
For this project, I completed the SQL Challenge provided by Pewlett Hackard. The challenge consisted of three main parts: data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis.

Data Modeling
Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD): I inspected the provided CSV files and sketched an ERD using QuickDBD to visualize the relationships between the tables.
Data Engineering
Table Schema Creation: Based on the information from the CSV files, I designed table schemas for each of the six files, specifying data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.
SQL Table Creation: I created SQL tables in the correct order to handle foreign keys and imported the data from the CSV files into their corresponding tables.
Data Analysis
I performed various data analysis queries as instructed in the assignment:

Listed employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.
Listed first name, last name, and hire date for employees hired in 1986.
Listed the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.
Listed department number for each employee along with their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
Listed first name, last name, and sex of employees named Hercules with last names beginning with the letter B.
Listed each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.
Listed each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
Listed the frequency counts, in descending order, of all employee last names.
Reflection
This project provided valuable hands-on experience in data modeling, database schema design, and SQL query writing. I gained a deeper understanding of relational databases and learned practical skills that will be beneficial in future projects and roles.
